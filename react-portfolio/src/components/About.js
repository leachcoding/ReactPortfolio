        <p>Hey, I'm Jay, a full-stack developer in the Appalachian MOuntains. I currently TL for Lambda School.</p>

        <p>I'm obsessed with technology, passionate about clean, semantic code, out of the box thinking, and accessibility for all. As a developer always looking to learn, try new things, and push the boundaries of what I think capable,  I strive to be the best I can be and have my work reflect the passion I feel for software developement.</p>

        <p>I paint, hike, and lift weights in the meantime, while also enjoying hanging out with my gf Kristie and doggo, Scout.</p>
